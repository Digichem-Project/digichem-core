Welcome to the Silico config directory.

All files ending in '.yaml' in this directory (and any subdirectories) will be loaded in alphabetical order (by filename).

Note that the subdirectories here are for organisational purposes only; any config file can go in any subdirectory (a basis set could go in the Calculation directory for example).

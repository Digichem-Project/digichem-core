This directory contains config files for freezing (compiling) with the excellent PyInstaller.

Freezing is particularly useful for silico because many of the servers/clusters it is designed to run on do not have functioning python installations, or are otherwise missing dependencies that are hard to satisfy without root/sudo access (Openbabel v3 and Weasyprint both fall under this category because they depend on binaries external to python).

CentOS/Redhat are the main OSes supported, but only because they are common choices for server clusters. It is relatively trivial to freeze against a different OS, you simply need a functioning virtual (or real) machine that accurately mirrors the target system. Minor alterations to the relative pyinstaller specs may be required, particularly to locate required binaries.

Silico will compile happily on CentOS 7.7 (and derivatives) and later.
Silico will compile with limited functionality on CentOS 6.10; all programs will function as normal except silico report (it does not seem possible to satisfy weasyprint's dependencies at present).
Compiling against older systems has not been attempted; but so long as Python 3.6 is available it should be possible.

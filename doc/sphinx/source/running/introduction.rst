Introduction to Using Silico
============================


The Sub-Programs
----------------
The various functionality of Silico is split into a number of sub-programs. These can be accessed
by specifying the name of the desired sub-program after the silico command. For example, to use
the submit program:

.. code-block:: console

    silico submit

Each sub-program also has a 3-letter and 1-letter short code by which it can be accessed.
There is no functional difference between using the short codes or the full name, so the user is
encouraged to use whichever style they prefer. For the purposes of this document, all examples
will use the 3-letter short code (unless otherwise stated). As example, the submit program can also
be accessed by any of the following commands:

.. code-block:: console

    silico sub

or:

.. code-block:: console

    silico s

A list of the available sub-programs is given below:

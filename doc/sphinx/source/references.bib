    abstract={A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of
        chemical structures between different formats. While standard
        interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and
        de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need
        to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude
        of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the
        data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and
        competition between software along with a lack of vendor-neutral
        formats.},

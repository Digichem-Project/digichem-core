How To Use This Document
========================

This document is the main reference manual for the Silico computational software suite.
It contains documentation for all the main functionality of Silico, as well as a :ref:`walk-through tutorial <tutorial>` for those who are new to the suite.

Images are included for comparison and reference.

Supplementary information and helpful tips are displayed separately, as follows:

.. note::
	This is a tip.

Commands that should be typed by the user are displayed in the following format:

.. code-block:: console

	$ echo Hello world
	
The dollar sign character ('$') itself should not be typed by the user; it is simply used to indicate that the text following should be entered as a command.
This is helpful to distinguish between commands (which should be typed) and the resulting output (which will appear without the dollar sign):

.. code-block:: console

	$ echo Hello world
	Hello world

In the above example, the user is being instructed to type: ``echo Hello world``.
The computer, in response, gives the output: ``Hello world``.

Ellipses (...) indicate that the real, full output has been truncated:

.. code-block:: console

	$ cat /etc/fstab
	# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
	#
	...

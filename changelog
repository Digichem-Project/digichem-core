- Added SLURM info to csubmit showing number of free nodes/CPUs per partition.
- Improved usage messages for cresult
- Fixed a bug with multiple name columns in cresult

[0.9.0 (16/06/2020)]
- Completely rewrote cresult
- cresult now supports much more powerful section options; especially for the CSV/table formats which are now variable width (eg, can include certain excited states)
- Initial version of csubmit; supporting SLURM and g09

[0.8.3 (31/05/2020)]
- Fixed a bug that caused the coords of dipole moments to be reported in their original orientation and not the orientation of the chosen alignment method.
- Fixed the same bug above which similarly affected atom coords in reports (but not in results).

[0.8.2 (27/05/2020)]
- Blank pages should no longer be inserted after tables that take up exactly one page (maybe...)

- Tweaks to rendering styles: renamed 'silico' to 'sharp', added 'pastel', 'light-pastel' and 'dark-pastel'
- Tweaks to excited states, orbitals, absorption and frequency graphs.
- Improved layout of excited states diagrams, reducing overlapping text

[0.8.1 (19/05/2020)]

- The quality/size of Gaussian cube files can now be controlled by a config option.
- Additional config files can now be specified on the command line.
- Added a new alignment method: Adjusted Average Angle
- Fixed a bug that caused molecule images to be rotated incorrectly

[0.8.0 (11/05/2020)]
- Fixed a bug in all alignment methods where rotations were recorded incorrectly, leading to incorrect dipole angles.
- Fixed a bug in VMD rendering where rotations were not properly implemented, leading to the molecule sometimes being 90 deg to the expected alignment.
- Added individual captions for each image in a group of images (eg, X/Y plane etc.)
- The units for angles can now be selected from degrees or radians.
- Report images are now stored in their own subdirectory (report/image).
- TDM now appears on the summary page.
- Reports can now now convert Gaussian .chk files to .fchk files in order to generate images.
- Development versions now use a modified version sting compared to releases (with an added '-dev' string).
- Renamed the 'Vanilla' alignment method to 'Minimal'.
- Added date to metadata (although this currently is the date of reading/loading, not when the calculation actually happened).
- Various bugfixes and improvements to excited state diagrams.
- Various improvements to matplotlib graphs, including migrating from pyplot -> OO style.
- Most matplotlib diagrams now scale depending on how much data there is to display (eg, MO diagrams will now be much taller if there is a big HOMO/LUMO gap.)
- Molecular structures in dipole moment images are now partially transparent to show the dipole more clearly.
- Restructured the internals that manage report images.
- Altered the signature of creport so it can now automatically determine the type of calculation result file given to it.
- Added the About section to the end of reports and improved the bibliography so it's now clearer which references to cite.
- Images are now created in their own individual sub-folders (ie: report/image/Dipole Moment).
- 3D molecule/orbital images can now optionally be rendered in a style mimicking that of GaussView.
- Added a second version of the MO energy diagram that shows only the HOMO/LUMO. 
- Greatly expanded the config file with a number of options for fine tuning report generation.

[0.7]
- Fixed a unit conversion bug in transition dipole moments that caused all TDM to be too small.
- Fixed a bug in Kebab+ that caused it to rotate all structures by exactly 90 deg and nothing else. Kebab+ now functions as intended.
- Added config files
- Improved error reporting, different levels of exception detail are now printed depending on log level.
- The default alignment method has been set to vanilla, as this was the (unintended) default prior to Kebab+ being fixed (and tends to give better results anyway).

[0.6.4]
- Implemented a new material style for orbitals when rendering with VMD, inspired by https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566119919304185?
- creport can now create orbital energy diagrams.
- creport tables now take up the whole page width.
- creport excited state diagrams are now to scale (behind the scenes the rendering method has completely changed from pure HTML/CSS to matplotlib).

[0.6.3]
- Fixed some missing data in the 'summary' and 'csv' formats of cresult.
- Changed the colour of carbon atoms when rendering with VMD from cyan to grey/black.
- Changed the scale on absorption graphs so peaks near the extremes of the scale aren't obviously cut in half. 

[0.6.2]
- Fixed a crash caused by geometry data not being handed to the transition dipole moment constructor

[0.6.1]
- Fixed a bug with the tachyon render not supporting whitespace in filenames

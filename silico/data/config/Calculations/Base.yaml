# The amount of 'dynamic memory' to use for the calculation (https://gaussian.com/link0/).
# Note that the amount of memory actually used by Gaussian can far exceed the value set here (at least in G09, not sure why).
memory: 20GB

# Number of processes/threads to use.
num_CPUs: 8

# Options that control use of the scratch directory.
# Set scratch_structure: None to disable scatch.
scratch_options:
    # Path to the directory to use for scratch. For each calculation, a unique subdirectory will be created under this root directory.
    path: /scratch
    
    # If True, directories created in the scratch directory will be contained in a subdirectory for each user (so the path would become eg, /scratch/<USERNAME>/<CALC_ID>).
    use_username: True
    
    # Whether to copy everything from scratch to output (on success or failures). Normally False is safe here as important output will already have been moved, but if there is a particular temp file that you need, set this to True.
    keep: False
    
    # Whether to copy everything from scratch to output on failure. True is safer as there is not risk of an important file being lost, but can involve copying huge files that aren't needed.
    rescue: False
    
    # If True, the scratch directory is always deleted after the calculation has completed, even if the calculation failed or if the results could not be copied back to the output directory.
    # This is normally unsafe, but on Kennedy we can't easily get access to the scratch anyway, so we might as well cleanup after ourselves.
    force_delete: True
    
    # If True, all calculation output will be written to the scratch directory. If False, only intermediate files will be written to scratch. Note that the .log file is always written to the true output directory to allow the calculation to be monitored.
    all_output: True

# Options that control the calculations folder structure.
structure:
    # Whether to use a separate subfolder for each calculation program.
    program_sub_folder: False
    # Whether to prepend the calculation program name to the calculation folder.
    prepend_program_name: True
    # Whether to append the calculation program name to the calculation folder.
    append_program_name: False
    

# Whether to write silico result files once the calculation has complete.
# The files writen are the same as can be aquired by using cresult later, they are small text files so there is generally little reason to set this to False.
# This option only controls writing of additional silico result files; even if write_results is False, the output files produced by the calculation (.log, .out etc) will still be saved. 
write_summary: True

# Whether to generate a PDF report once the calculation has complete.
# The report written is the same as can be aquired by using creport later.
# Silico reports can be large (10s to 100s of MB) and take several minutes to render (depending on the calculation and available computing power of course). This option can be disabled to save on space/time.

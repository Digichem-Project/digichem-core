# Config for a gaussian calculation.
CLASS: Gaussian

# The programs that this calculation is compatible with.
programs: [g09, g16]

# Gaussian calculation options.
# The number of processors to use. More processors will generally shorten the overall calculation time, but this relationship may not be linear.
# If you wish to specify the exact processors to utilise (not sure why you would, but apparently this is preferred by Gaussian), use the 'CPU_list' option instead.
#CPU_list: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31]
# On Kennedy, the default is normally 32 CPUs (an entire node).
# This is probably extremely wasteful
#num_CPUs: 32

# If True, a formated checkpoint file (.fchk) will be created automatically after the calculation has finished.
convert_chk: True

# If False, the .chk file will be deleted automatically.
# False is mostly safe here as the .chk/.fchk conversion is mostly reversible, however know that there is some data that is lost converting from .chk to .fchk (data needed to calculate NTOs, for example).
keep_chk: False

# These options are added to the Gaussian route section with only minor modification:
#       Options of the form 'Foo: Bar' will become 'Foo=Bar'
#       Options of the form 'Foo: ""'  will become 'Foo'
#   Options of the form 'Foo: null' will be deleted (useful for unsetting something from a default).
# You can add any option here that you like (though if the option is not recognised by Gaussian then the calculation will not complete successfully.
options:
    # The integration grid size to use. Choice of grid size is a reasonably advanced topic that is not discussed here, but know that larger grid size increases both computational accuracy and cost (and not necessarily in a linear fashion).
    # Gaussian recommends at least the ultrafine grid, see the manual for other options.
    
    # Optional empirical dispersion, possible options include:
    # GD2: D2 version of Grimme’s dispersion.
    # GD3: D3 version of Grimme’s dispersion.
    # GD3BJ: D3 version of Grimme’s dispersion with Becke-Johnson damping.
    # See the Gaussian manual for other options.
    # Also, note that certain functionals contain dispersion by nature/default (eg, B2PLYPD3) 
    #EmpiricalDispersion: GD3BJ

    # Controls how symmetry is used in the calculation. There are many options here (again, see the Gaussian manual), but generally either 'Tight' or 'Loose' is sufficient for most cases. Tight is the default; loose is "designed for use with suboptimal input geometrie" (https://gaussian.com/symmetry/).
    Symmetry: Tight

    # Among other things, the Population option controls how much information is printed in the calculation log file (but does not affect the .chk file?). Regular or Full are the most likely options.
#    Population: Full
    Population: Regular

    # This option controls which density to use with the Population option. 'Current' is generally what you want, but alternatives may be required for eg MP2.
    Density: Current

# Resource allocation: 
# The number of tasks to allocate for (this can often be thought of as the number of parallel processes being launched; if srun is being called multiple times (or launches multiple parallel processes), this should match the number of processes. Note that tasks can be distributed over different nodes (computers).
num_tasks: 1
# The number of CPUs to allocate per task (parallel job). If num_tasks is 1, then this is the number of CPUs to allocate (eg, for a multithreaded program). Unlike tasks, CPUs cannot be distributed over different nodes (computers).
# The default is to use the same number of CPUs as the calculation uses.
CPUs_per_task: auto

# The amount of memory to allocate per CPU.
